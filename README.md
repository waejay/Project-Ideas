# Project-Ideas
This repository simply stores (in the README) ideas for side projects I'd like to try out.

# Projects:

- Word-timing-extractor: using speech-to-text, return a list of times in which a certain word has been said (for a more advanced approach, return not an exact time but a "duration", aka a start time and an end time in which the word had been said)
